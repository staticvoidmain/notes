<p>Credits to the amazing web series 'You Suck at Photoshop' for the inspiration for this. It's one of my favorites from the early days of youtube.</p>
<p>The unique blend of practical advice and sardonic dark humor is enormously entertaining, and I hope to achieve a similar motif here.</p>
I won't be quite as mean as Donny; I won't openly berate you, but I think that generally people who use visual studio do so because they know it's the de-facto IDE for .Net and that's what they have to use, not because it's the best editor, or because they know it really well.

<h1>Perspective</h1>
<p>To put that in perspective, let's look at it visually.</p>
<p><a href="./images/editor_money.gif">Wasted Dollars</a></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Now, to be fair, it's probably not really coming out of your pocket, so you don't really <em>have</em> to care as much, but at least learn to leverage the investment to improve your quality of life.</p>
<p>It makes sense to invest in the best tools possible, but if you don't really understand how to exploit that value, you may as well spend 0.5% of the asking price on a personal copy of Sublime Text 3 or VSCode</p>
[1] You should always have a lightweight and competent text editor for making small quick changes. Change the default C# file assocation to use this editor instead of Visual Studio. [2] Notepad++ is terrible. Stop using it.

<section id="your-tools-matter" class="slide level1">
<h1>Your tools matter</h1>
<p>I shouldn't have to tell you this, but you spend a lot of time typing text into a computer. You have</p>
<ul>
<li>Your text editor should be an extension of you.</li>
<li>brain -&gt; keyboard -&gt; screen</li>
<li>If you spend most of your time wrangling your tooling to get it to work right, either your tools suck, or you suck.</li>

<h1>Bad defaults</h1>
<p>Sane defaults are a big deal. Visual Studio is, getting better, but it's still not completely sane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ugly</li>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Bloated</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it's just basic and bloated.</p>
<aside>
The stock-standard Visual Studio instance is not really a thing of beauty or productivity. Sure, you can file-&gt;New Project and get going right away, but the color scheme is an affront to the eye, and it doesn't really do much besides run msbuild for you.

We're gonna follow the same logic when customizing our environment as you might when optimizing code, which is focus on the &quot;Hot Path&quot;. You should be impatient and demanding of your editor.

<p>Well what if I told you there were some maaagical settings that would speed up your build, help visual studio launch quicker, and generally help you capture some of that 6-grand your company blew on it. Ross, you're crazy. What sane person wouldn't want that? If those settings existed they would be on by defau...hhhh crap.</p>
