<p>Credits to the amazing web series 'You Suck at Photoshop' for the inspiration for this. It's one of my favorites from the early days of youtube.</p>
<p>The unique blend of practical advice and sardonic dark humor is enormously entertaining, and I hope to achieve a similar motif here.</p>
I won't be quite as mean as Donny; I won't openly berate you, but I think that generally people who use visual studio do so because they know it's the de-facto IDE for .Net and that's what they have to use, not because it's the best editor, or because they know it really well.

<p>Now, to be fair, it's probably not really coming out of your pocket, so you don't really <em>have</em> to care as much, but at least learn to leverage the investment to improve your quality of life.</p>
<p>It makes sense to invest in the best tools possible, but if you don't really understand how to exploit that value, you may as well spend 0.5% of the asking price on a personal copy of Sublime Text 3 or VSCode</p>
[1] You should always have a lightweight and competent text editor for making small quick changes. Change the default C# file assocation to use this editor instead of Visual Studio. [2] Notepad++ is terrible. Stop using it.

The stock-standard Visual Studio instance is not really a thing of beauty or productivity. Sure, you can file-&gt;New Project and get going right away, but the color scheme is an affront to the eye, and it doesn't really do much besides run msbuild for you.
