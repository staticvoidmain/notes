# Letting Go: A requiem for my youth

I don't often talk about myself, or the things that drive me, and I think today is a special day when the truth of things should be laid bare. What a treat for you, dear reader! To get a chance to peer behind the curtain and see the sentimental man behind the giant talking head.

> I am the great and powerful SMUG.

Alas, it is not so. It's all an act. I'm still the same shy nerd I've always been inside. I'm more outwardly confident these days, and I have this tiny platform and a readership numbering in the dozens, but I'm still that guy deep down.

Today **is** special, because I turned in my resignation today after 11.7980037352215 years working for the same company.

I've often (as in constantly) been asked "Why are you still there!?", and the truth is, I ran out of satisfying answers, so, I've decided I won't celebrate my 12 year work anniversary. I used to say it was the people, but most of the good people left a long time ago. Then I thought it was because they cared about me, but they don't. There's a video of me in my late early 20s floating around of Bruno asking me "Why do **YOU** work for Santander", and I sheepishly answered, "Because they let me express myself creatively." 

Self delusion or naivete? You be the judge.

Finally, it came. 

**I'm scared.**

I didn't want to leave because it's scary out there, and this place had not prepared me for life on the outside.


# Dropping Out
## I did it for the money

_TL;DR_

- The money was too good. 
- The classes were good but not great.
- The commute was brutal.

Incentives work, but not always in the way you expect. When someone says "You can have a fulltime salary now, or continue to be underpaid and finish your degree..." that's an out I would wager few college students would begrudge me for taking. It was short-sighted ultimately, and I have paid the price for that mistake many times over.

Learn from my mistakes kids. Stay in school.

# Breaking Things
It's not all happy memories, and I think no careful accounting of my history with Drive/SC would be complete without owning up to my failures.

## That time Ryan and I took down Production (for a few seconds)
This blog is technical right? Well here's a fun technical annecdote for you. Back in the day, on ye-olde Windows Server 2003+IIS6, if you wanted to swap the version of the .Net framework used by a particular application pool, you had to click through a series of menus and opt-in to the new version. This was before I had learned the peace that comes from embracing the command line.

We were a much smaller company then, so I waltz over to my sysadmin buddy Ryan and the exchange went something like this:

> Yo man

> Hey Chief

> Can you do me a favor?

> Sure man whatcha need?

> My shit isn't working. Can you log in to this production box and flip this over to .net 3.5? It's totally safe.

_[ IIS Resets ]_

> Oh fuck...

He took the fall for me and it cost him his bonus for the month. My bad bro. My bad. I'm still the same developer, running around without shoes on. 

Some things never change.

## Bad Decisions

I don't have any fun annecdotes for these. This is my public apology for endorsing Sitecore, failing to deliver NCache, shunning Wordpress for static pages and writing that god-awful 2000+ line javascript file that is so needlessly complex, simply because I wanted to reinvent all the wheels. You guys, look at all those closures!

# Victories

- Interns
  - Oh my beloved interns. So full of curiosity and optimism. It has been my sincerest pleasure working with you all, even if it did keep me artificially at the company well past my expiration date. I'm leaving with a heavy heart knowing I won't be around to see the new crop of interns flow in, and that last year's Bootcamp might have been the last.

- Trainees
  - We took call center reps and made them programmers. I literally made men (and a few women) in my image. I am Smug almighty.

- Marketing Reconciliation
  - In my autumn years of this place, my greatest joy has been working with my friends over in the Marketing department again. It was nice to finally put down the guns and end the blood-feud that was started so many many years ago. We carried those same animosities around with us as a culture, long after most of the older generation who started the fighting had gone.

# Change Comes Slowly
## and sometimes not at all

Not much to show for over a decade of service. After the dust settled, and all the features and bug fixes are tallied, nothing was ever **solved**, we just kept doing what we've always done, as all companies of sufficient mass are wont to do.

# Purge Yourself

If you are the best, and everyone knows it, why would you stay? You are stagnating if you (like me) were insecure about looking elsewhere. If you (like me) think that your company has your best interest at heart, you clearly don't understand how business works.

I've probably cost myself a ridiculous amount of money over the years due to my sick sense of duty to the place that gave me my start, and for what? It always ends. We aren't a family, we never were. What was I thinking?

Don't be like me. Set a timer. Evict yourself after two years, or sooner if things go poorly. The cache is no place for you. Move on.

_Yours Smugly,_
