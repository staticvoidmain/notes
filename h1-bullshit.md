# Yo

# America. 

# Pull your head out of your ass.

# Protecting American Jobs? 

# We're supposed to be the fucking best.

Since when do we settle for less? C'mon 'Merica... what gives?

If you grew up in fucking **America**, and a dude who originated in a country that has:

* No free/public english-language education
* No social safety net
* Insane academic competition
* Rampant political corruption
* Routine rolling power outages
* A sanitation system that involves a tanker on the top of his home
* A **random** lottery from a pool of 

"stole" your job... What the **fuck** were you even doing?

# Thought Experiment

If a homeless guy fucks your wife, _sure_ it's sad, but on a certain level, do you not see how that's your fault? Once you fight through the pain, and the anger, and the disgust, introspect a little bit. I mean, look at this guy, he hasn't showered in months, he has no money, no permanent address. You have **every** advantage over this guy. So if your wife decided to fuck him, what does this say about *you*?

Further, now that it's happened, what are you going to do about it? Are you going to lament your sad fate and make sure none of your future girlfriends ever have male acquaintances? Will you glare at every hobo you see until the day you die, constantly sure that he's plotting to fuck your wife? Or will you do the sensible thing and just try to be a better husband so that shit doesn't happen again. Which reality do you want to live in?

TODO: the bit about how after he fucked your wife, his whole life changed for the better.
