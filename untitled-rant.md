# Smug Rant
## 

# Disclaimer

- I may never work again, at least not **for** anyone else.
- Mandatory Entrepeneurship, here I come!

# What this is

- A call to action for developers.
- A flaming bag of poo on the doorstep of every bad manager.

# What this is not

- An excuse to point fingers and be lazy.
- If you are a bad programmer, you're equally out the door.

# Who am I?

What right do I have to say these outlandish things?

# Nobody

- Zero degree
- Zero management training
- I'm every programmer you have ever met, I just suddently decided to start telling the truth

- "The Communist Manifesto" -> Google it I guess?

# Dial it back

- Okay okay...
- I'm not calling for open rebellion here 
- also I never read the manifesto

# WTF?

- The love of a Good Woman
- A good glass of Scotch
- FACTS

# KYW

Know Your Worth

- Take your salary. 
- Now **double** it.
- Add $20,000 for everything you know that nobody else does 
- This is what it costs the company to replace you.

# Hold People Accountable

- Your leadership is accountable
- You control the means of production
- You _have_ to speak up (OR find an advocate) 

# Leaders and Managers

There is in fact a difference.

- Being a manager is easy.
- Being a leader takes **work**

# Hard Truth
- Most people in leadership positions are really bad at it.
- They are likely insecure about this. Sorry.
- I don't think they are bad people, but they need to get better.

# Promoting From Within

- Often done for the wrong reasons
- Often a bad idea. see: Peter Principle

# WIFM?

You get to keep your cushy desk job.

# Just kidding

- All the money!

- Companies with higher workplace satisfaction are also extremely successful.

# Do you even read?

> The Harvard Business Review recently published an analysis 
> of various studies that showed an average of 31 percent more 
> productivity and 37 percent higher sales when employees are happy or satisfied.
