Friends, I have a staggering truth to tell, which, once heard, will rock you to your very core and defy everything you know about programmers. You can actually talk to us.

I know, I know. It's shocking. Take a deep breath. Breath into a paper bag if necessary.

Hear me out.

Just because I know how to type text into a computer and make it do things, doesn't mean I can't relate to other humans. Plenty of programmers are well-spoken, personable, if not perhaps a little quirky, individuals.
