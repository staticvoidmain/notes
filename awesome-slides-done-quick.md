A quick walkthrough of my writing and publishing process for everything.

# Content vs Presentation

- Think like a programmer
- Do not author in the output format

# Nerds Like Text

- It's searchable
- It's Cross Platform
- No special viewers
- It's SMALL
- IT'S VERSIONABLE ahhhhh

# Minimize Friction

- If you can remove the things that get between your thoughts and your words, you're gonna have a good time.

# MARKDOWN

If you are a programmer who does not use and love markdown, what the fuck mate, get with it.

# Not just for slides

Do this for your:

- Design Docs
- Blog Entries
- Meeting Notes

# Honorable Mention

* Org-Mode: A super advanced 
* reStructured Text
* LaTex

# Get the Tools

- Decent Text Editor (Emacs, Vim, VsCode, Sublime, Atom?)
